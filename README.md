# Cooper Converter

This python script converts pretalx JSON timetables/Schedule in to the format used for [Cooper/Ministraitor](https://twitter.com/Ministraitor)'s recording rigs

As of now all variables are hard-coded (E.g. Schedule URL, Room Name, etc)

Once ran it will print the config to your terminal, a simple ``python3 main.py > file.txt`` will give all you need

Is it janky? - Yes.

Does it work? - Yes!

Do I like Python? - No, But for this, it was the easiest for me to make a Proof of Concept with.

What would I have used? - C# JS, mainly as I prefer them, but they all have there advantages and disadvantages.

C# Really? Are you joking? - No, I've spent a good year using it, its by no lenght the best language and have come to quite like it, but thats another story for another day
